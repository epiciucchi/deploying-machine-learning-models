We will use the [H&M dataset released in a Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) and the [LightFM library](https://making.lyst.com/lightfm/docs/home.html). The session will cover data analysis, data sampling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and hybrid recommendation incorporating item features.\n",

        "\n",
        "### What is LightFM ?\n",
        "\n",
        "LightFM is a Python library designed for building and evaluating recommender systems. It is particularly well-suited for handling hybrid recommendation scenarios that combine collaborative filtering with content-based methods. LightFM is known for its flexibility, allowing you to incorporate user and item metadata into the recommendation process, which can significantly improve the accuracy of your recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features of LightFM\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tFlexible Hybrid Models: LightFM allows for the combination of collaborative and content-based filtering by integrating item and user features.\n",
        "2.\tDifferent Loss Functions: LightFM supports several loss functions for training models, including:\n",
        "    - WARP (Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise): Optimizes for ranking quality, suitable for implicit feedback data.\n",
        "    - BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking): Optimizes for pairwise ranking, commonly used in implicit feedback scenarios.\n",
        "    - Logistic: Suitable for explicit feedback.\n",
        "    - WARP-kos: A variant of WARP for use with highly sparse datasets.\n",
        "3.\tScalability: Designed to efficiently handle large datasets.\n",
        "4.\tEase of Use: Provides a simple and intuitive API for model training and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Components of a LightFM Model\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tInteractions Matrix: Represents user-item interactions. In our case, it will be a sparse matrix where rows represent users and columns represent items, and the values represent interactions (e.g., purchases).\n",
        "2.\tUser and Item Features: Optional matrices that include additional information about users and items. For this lab, we will incorporate item features to build a hybrid model.\n",
        "3.\tLoss Function: Defines how the model is trained. We will experiment with different loss functions to optimize our recommendations.\n",

        "\n",
        "Over the course of this project, we designed, optimized, and evaluated a recommender system based on the LightFM framework, progressively moving from a pure collaborative filtering (CF) setup to a hybrid feature-augmented model capable of handling real-world challenges such as data sparsity and cold-start items.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Collaborative Filtering Stage**\n",
        "We first implemented and tuned a WARP-based CF model on 1.2M users × 90k items.After hyperparameter refinement, the model achieved:\n",
        "\n",
        "- AUC ≈ 0.83, showing strong overall ranking quality.\n",
        "- Precision@10 ≈ 0.3% and Recall@10 ≈ 0.9%, reasonable given the dataset’s high sparsity and implicit feedback nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "This stage demonstrated that latent factors capture meaningful user–item interactions, but also revealed the model’s limitations in personalization depth and diversity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**User Segmentation & Qualitative Checks**\n",
        "\n",
        "By segmenting users by interaction volume:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Casual users achieved slightly higher recall, driven by popular items.\n",
        "- Active users benefited less, highlighting popularity bias in implicit models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Manual inspection of recommendations confirmed:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Logical, category-consistent results (e.g., grouped by swimwear or denim lines).\n",
        "- Limited novelty and diversity, with frequent duplicates or color variants.\n",
        "\n",
        "These insights motivated moving beyond pure CF toward hybridization.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hybrid Modeling with Item Metadata**\n",
        "\n",
        "We enriched item representations with categorical features such as product group, type, section, and color.\n",
        "This produced a sparse feature matrix and enabled hybrid training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although precision and recall on the global TEST sample slightly decreased (due to higher model complexity and limited feature granularity), the hybrid model demonstrated strong generalization ability, paving the way for addressing cold-start issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Cold-Start Simulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Under cold-start conditions (2,000 items hidden during training):\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pure CF collapsed to AUC ≈ 0.07, unable to rank unseen products.\n",
        "- Hybrid LightFM maintained AUC ≈ 0.80, thanks to item metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "This striking contrast confirms that hybrid recommenders are crucial for dynamic catalogs, where new products appear regularly.\n",
